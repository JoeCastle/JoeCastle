### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joe, a full-stack software developer with experience building bespoke web applications including optimising performance, collaborating effectively with teams, and providing valuable post-mortem analysis to improve code quality. Iâ€™m proficient with React, MobX, TypeScript, SCSS, C#, .NET, and T-SQL.

With 5 years of hands-on expertise, I specialize in developing bespoke web applications, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my skills to create impactful software. I have experience building comprehensive software solutions from end to end, covering front-end, back-end, and database architecture.

In my work, I prioritize clean code, documentation, testing, user experience and continuous learning, which enables me to deliver high-quality solutions that align with best practices and industry standards. I am constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Beyond coding, I value effective communication and teamwork. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, and turning complex ideas into user-friendly solutions.

Best regards,\
Joe
